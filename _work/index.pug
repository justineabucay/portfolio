                        p Hello! My name is Justine, and I am a student at Simon Fraser University's School of Interactive Arts and Technology, focusing on Visual Design, Web Design, and UX Design.
                        
                        p I've always loved experimenting and creating. As a child, I made things out of scraps of paper, guided purely by imagination. That same curiosity led me to open Photoshop for the first time in high school — and since then, I've been hooked. I found myself in deep fascination with graphic design and the art of visual storytelling.
                        
                        p As I continue my studies, I'm eager to take my learning beyond the classroom — to gain hands-on experience in the real world. I'm deeply passionate about exploring, experimenting, and refining my craft as I grow as a designer.
